This is my HelloWorld.md file for the Coursera Final Project
------------------------------------------------------------

I need to include the following text:

## This is a markdown file

That's pretty much it. Other good stuff:

This should render *italic* (as should _this_), while this should render **BOLD** (as should __this__), but not this ~~StrikeThru~~ text :)

Of course, the power of MarkDown is the ability to discuss `code` and such:

```python
myVar = "Hello World"
print myVar
```

Oh! And I saved this on my laptop and used `git` to *git* it over to GitHub :)
